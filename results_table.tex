\subsection{Connections to Littlewood's Conjecture}

We show the energy radiated in the convective region to be proportional to the mass in the radiative layer between the stellar surface and the upper boundary of the convective zone, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig1} and in a tabular form, in Table 1. Both {\it tori} and {\it riq} are designed to measure individuals; aggregations of individuals such as countries, universities, and departments, can be characterized by simple summary statistics, such as the number of scientists and their mean {\it riq}. An extension of {\it tori} to measure journals would be straight forward: it would consist of the simple removal of the normalization by the number of authors.

\caption{\textbf{Some descriptive statistics about fruit and vegetable consumption among high school students in the U.S.}}
\end{table}

While bananas and apples still top the list of most popular fresh fruits, the amount of bananas consumed grew from 7 pounds per person in 1970 to 10.4 pounds in 2010, whereas consumption of fresh apples decreased from 10.4 pounds to 9.5 pounds. Watermelons and grapes moved up in the rankings.
