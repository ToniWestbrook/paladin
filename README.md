PALADIN is a protein sequence alignment tool designed for the accurate functional characterization of metagenomes.

PALADIN is based on BWA, and aligns sequences via read-mapping using BWT. PALADIN, however, offers the novel approach of aligning in the protein space.  During the index phase, it processes the reference genome's nucleotide sequences and GTF/GFF annotation containing CDS entries, first converting these transcripts into the corresponding protein sequences, then creating the BWT and suffix array from these proteins. The process of translatation is skiped when providing a protein reference file (e.g., UniProt) for mapping. During the alignment phase, it attempts to find ORFs in the read sequences, then converts these to protein sequences, and aligns to the reference protein sequences. 

PALADIN currently only supports single-end reads (or reads merged with FLASH, PEAR, abyss-mergepairs), and BWA-MEM based alignment. It makes use of many BWA parameters and is therefore compatible with many of its command line arguments.

PALADIN may output a standard SAM file, or a text file containing a UniProt-generated functional profile. This text file may be used for all downstream characterizations. 


INSTALLATION
--
**Dependencies**

- libcurl-dev. This should be available on Ubuntu using `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`
- Other things

```
git clone https://github.com/twestbrookunh/paladin.git
cd paladin/
make
PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
```

**Sample Command**


Download and prepare UniProt index files.
```
paladin prepare -r0 
```

Index UniProt (or another protein) fasta.
```
paladin index -f -r2 uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz
```
Align a set of reads using 4 theads. Send the full UniProt report to paladin_uniprot_report.txt.
